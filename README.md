# Darwin
Darwin is an evolutionary UI engine. Instead of boring 2D dashboards, we render website components as 3D gravity wells and users as swarming agents. We pipe this behavioral data into Google Gemini, which acts as an autonomous UX designer—analyzing the clusters and writing actual code patches to fix usability issues on the fly.
